## 📂 Outputs

This action does not produce any outputs. It creates the directory structure in the repository.

---

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

- The action creates the directory at: `btp-insuite/PartnerDirectory/{partner-id}/`
- If the directory already exists, it is completely removed and recreated.
- All four JSON files are required inputs.
- The JSON files are renamed during copy to match the standard naming convention.
- This action is typically used after downloading Partner Directory data from BTP.
- Ensure the working directory is set correctly (the action uses `btp-insuite` as the working directory).
